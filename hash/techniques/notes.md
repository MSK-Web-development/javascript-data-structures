# Hashing

- localStorage is a hash map.
- location = location; will refresh the page.

# Characters of a good hash function

1. Deterministic: Equal keys produce equal hash values.
2. Efficiency: It should be O(1) in time.
3. Uniform distribution: It makes the most use of the array.
4. It should never evaluate to zero. Zero gives the initial hash value.
