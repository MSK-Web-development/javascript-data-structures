# What are linear and non-linear data Structures?

# Linear:

A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. Examples: Array. Linked List, Stacks and Queues.

# Non-Linear:

A data structure is said to be non-linear if the traversal of nodes is nonlinear in nature. Example: Graph and Trees.
